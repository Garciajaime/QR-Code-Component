## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Figma



### What I learned

I got some experience using a Figma file for a design reference. It definitely made 
things easier. I got reaquainted with a lot of css concepts such as creating variables and using flex box. The main thing I had to learn was how to properly use height and width for my objects. I learned that I should just let the browser handle setting the width and height and adjusting it itself. I should generally just use max-width and min-height. Units should preferably be in rem since it scales. All in all this was a good
refresher. 


### Continued development

I want to be able to implement some more advanced CSS techniques. Right now I just have a basic understanding of CSS so it would be nice to be able to create more advanced things.Apart fromt that I also want to develop a strong workflow when tackling a project. Right now I am unsure of what the best approach is when receiving a new project. Should I set all variables first, look at the design file layers etc. 


### Useful resources

- [A practical guide to responsive web design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4u1yp3Msao&list=PLgGufYhDjahUM_Np3Nxu6VwDINTdWHMVT&index=7&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This helped me understand responsive design. I adjusted my website using some of these tips and my website changes as the viewport changes.
